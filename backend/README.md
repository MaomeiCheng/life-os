# backend (paused)

This folder is currently **not wired into the running application**.

Current state:
- Web app runs from `apps/web`.
- Backend strategy is TBD:
  - Option A: Next.js route handlers inside `apps/web`
  - Option B: Separate backend service here later

Do not treat this folder as production code until it is explicitly activated.
