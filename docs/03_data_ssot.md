# SSOT (Single Source of Truth) (DEFAULT v1, DRAFT)

## Location
SSOT root: `ssot/`

Recommended structure:
- `ssot/schema/`      # schemas, types, constraints
- `ssot/data/`        # canonical data (reference/seed inputs)
- `ssot/validators/`  # validation logic
- `ssot/exports/`     # generated artifacts (json/sql), generated by script

## Commands (default)
Add scripts in `package.json` (examples):
- `pnpm ssot:validate`
- `pnpm ssot:export`
- `pnpm ssot:seed`

## Validation Rules (minimum)
- JSON schema checks (or zod-based checks)
- Required fields present
- Unique IDs and referential integrity (when applicable)
- Deterministic export generation

## “Generated vs Source” Rule
- Anything inside `ssot/exports/` is **generated**.
- Do not hand-edit generated files.
- Prefer generating exports in CI to ensure determinism.

## Seed Strategy (default)
- For early stage: seed minimal reference tables.
- Keep user data out of seed; user data is created at runtime.

## Archived Import Artifacts (current)
Raw SSOT import files are stored here:
- `ssot/imports/xlsx/Personal_SSOT_Import.xlsx`
- `ssot/imports/xlsx/Music_SSOT_Import.xlsx`
- `ssot/imports/xlsx/Career_SSOT_Import.xlsx`

These are not the canonical SSOT yet. Next step is to convert them into:
- `ssot/schema/`
- `ssot/data/`
and add a validation command.
