# ADR 0001: Record Architecture Decisions

## Status
Proposed

## Context
We need a lightweight way to track decisions (stack, DB, deployment, structure).

## Decision
Use ADRs in `docs/adr/` for significant architecture choices.

## Consequences
- Decisions are visible and traceable.
- Easier handover and maintenance.
