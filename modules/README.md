# modules (paused)

This folder contains high-level module placeholders and is not yet integrated.

Current implementation path:
- Web app: `apps/web`
- Shared/module code will be migrated into:
  - `apps/web/src/modules/*` (recommended) or
  - `packages/*` if monorepo is adopted

Keep this folder as reference only until migration begins.
